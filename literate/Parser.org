#+TITLE: Parser
#+PROPERTY: header-args    :comments both :tangle ../src/Parser.js

* Preamble

#+begin_src js
import * as Block from "../src/Block";
#+end_src

* Actually parsing a stream of characters

I wrote code to pass just the simplest case first:

#+begin_src js
export const single = (source) => {
    if (source == "_") return Block.Blank();
}
#+end_src
